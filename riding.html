        In general, there are two different styles of horse riding: English and Western. English disciplines include dressage, show jumping, and cross country jumping (the types of equestrian events we see in the Olympics). English saddles are flatter, smaller, and with a shallower seat than Western saddles. In contrast, Western saddles are much larger, and designed to provide comfort and security for long hours spent in the saddle during cattle drives or trail rides. Most people are more familiar with Western saddles, as these are the ones often seen in movies, and always in rodeos.

        Proper riding attire includes boots with a low heel to prevent the rider's feet from getting stuck in the stirrups; long pants (jeans for Western riding and breeches for English riding); and a helmet. Many Western riders, and even some English riders, do not wear a helmet, but it is still strongly recommended.
