        We have over 50,000 books, videos, records, and magazines at our monthly Saturday sale. Items are donated by individuals, estates, and businesses, and some materials are items that have been weeded from the Palo Alto Library's shelves to make room for new materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come visit our friendly volunteers and pick up some new books at a deep discount. We donate 100% of the Book Sale proceeds to helping local libraries.
