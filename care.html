        Caring for a horse is very different from caring for a pet like a cat or a dog. Horses are large, fragile animals that often require individualized care. Since horses are herd animals, they thrive in the company of other horses.

      <h2 id="feeding-title">Feeding</h2>
      <p>
        Horses need to consume approximately 2% of their body weight every day, which amounts to about 20 pounds of hay for the average 1,000-pound horse. If horses are supplied with a sufficient amount of good-quality hay and/or pasture grass, this can be enough to sustain them. However, many horses also benefit from grain and supplements.
        <br>Horses also appreciate a variety of treats. Sugary treats like peppermints should be given sparingly, but some healthy treats that horses enjoy include:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Watermelon</li>
        <li>Granola bars</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 id="shelter-title">Shelter</h2>
      <p>
        Many people choose to keep their horses in stalls inside a barn, with daily pasture time during daylight hours. However, if provided adequate shelter, many horses thrive living outside 24 hours a day. Horses that are acclimated to living outside grow thick winter coats to help them stay warm. A three-sided shelter should also be provided for protection from the wind and precipitation.
