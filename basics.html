        Horses are domestic hooved animals that evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years. Humans began domesticating horses approximately 4000 BC, and although they are no longer essential to human livelihood like they once were -- especially for transportation and farming -- horses are still widely appreciated, typically for competition and pleasure riding.

        Horses are prey animals, and therefore have many adaptations geared toward running: a strong fight-or-flight response, excellent senses of hearing and smell, and the ability to sleep standing up.
      <p>
        Depending on the breed of horse and the type of care it receives, an average domestic horse can live to be as old as 30 years. Baby horses, or foals, are born after a gestation period of 11 months. A colt is a male horse under the age of four, and a filly is a female horse under the age of four. A mare is a female horse four years and older, while a stallion is a male horse four years and older. A gelding is a castrated male horse of any age.
